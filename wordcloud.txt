"""The subject of Sex is difficult to deal with. There is no doubt a
natural reticence connected with it. There is also a great deal of
prudery. The passion occupies, without being spoken of, a large part of
human thought; and words on the subject being so few and inadequate,
everything that is said is liable to be misunderstood. Violent
inferences are made and equivocations surmised, from the simplest
remarks; qualified admissions of liberty are interpreted into
recommendations of unbridled license; and generally the perspective of
literary expression is turned upside down.

There is in fact a vast deal of fetishism in the current treatment of
the question. Nor can one altogether be surprised at this when one sees
how important Sex is in the scheme of things, and how deeply it has been
associated since the earliest times not only with man’s personal
impulses but even with his religious sentiments and ceremonials.

Next to hunger it is doubtless the most primitive and imperative of our
needs. But in modern civilized life Sex enters probably even more into
consciousness than hunger. For the hunger-needs of the human race are in
the later societies fairly well satisfied, but the sex-desires are
strongly restrained, both by law and custom, from satisfaction—and so
assert themselves all the more in thought.

To find the place of these desires, their utterance, their control,
their personal import, their social import, is a tremendous problem to
every youth and girl, man and woman."""
